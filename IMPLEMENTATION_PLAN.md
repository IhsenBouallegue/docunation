# Implementation Plan: Mastra Personal Document Assistant (POC)

This document outlines the phased implementation approach for building a proof-of-concept personal document assistant using the Mastra framework. The system will process personal documents, extract information, and help fill out forms like visa applications.

## Development Approach

This is an **experimental proof-of-concept** rather than a production tool. We'll:

- Focus on rapid development and iteration
- Take appropriate shortcuts where needed
- Prioritize functionality over optimization
- Use Mastra's agent and workflow capabilities extensively
- Test with sample documents rather than comprehensive datasets

## Phase 1: Document Processing Foundation

**Goal**: Set up the basic infrastructure for processing PDF documents using Mastra.

### Steps:
1. Create the document processing tool
2. Implement a simple document agent
3. Test basic PDF parsing functionality

### Implementation Details:
- Create `src/mastra/tools/documentTools.ts` with a basic PDF parser
- Create `src/mastra/agents/documentAgent.ts` with simple instructions
- Set up a test workflow to validate document processing
- Use Mastra's agent capabilities to handle document content
- Test with a few sample PDF documents

### Success Criteria:
- System can successfully parse PDF documents
- Basic text extraction works correctly
- Document agent can respond to simple queries about document content

## Phase 2: Vector Storage and Embeddings

**Goal**: Implement the storage system for document content and embeddings using Mastra's RAG capabilities.

### Steps:
1. Create vector database tools
2. Implement embedding generation
3. Set up storage and retrieval mechanisms

### Implementation Details:
- Leverage Mastra's built-in RAG capabilities
- Use `MDocument` and chunking from Mastra
- Use Mastra's embedding functions
- Set up a simple vector store for the POC
- Implement basic chunking for document storage

### Success Criteria:
- Documents are properly chunked and embedded
- Embeddings are stored in the vector database
- Basic retrieval of document chunks works

## Phase 3: Information Retrieval System

**Goal**: Build the RAG system to retrieve relevant information from stored documents.

### Steps:
1. Implement the retrieval mechanism using Mastra's tools
2. Create a query agent
3. Test information retrieval with sample queries

### Implementation Details:
- Use Mastra's vector query tools
- Create a simple agent with appropriate instructions
- Set up a workflow for information retrieval
- Use Mastra's workflow capabilities to orchestrate the process

### Success Criteria:
- System can retrieve relevant document chunks based on queries
- Agent can synthesize information from multiple chunks
- Responses are accurate and based on document content

## Phase 4: Form Filling Capabilities

**Goal**: Develop the form-filling functionality.

### Steps:
1. Create form tools
2. Implement the form agent
3. Set up form workflows

### Implementation Details:
- Create simple form templates for the POC
- Create a form-filling agent with Mastra
- Implement a workflow that connects document retrieval to form filling
- Use Mastra's workflow orchestration for the end-to-end process

### Success Criteria:
- System can identify required information for specific forms
- Agent can extract relevant information from documents
- Forms are filled out with information from documents

## Phase 5: Basic Integration

**Goal**: Connect all components into a simple working POC.

### Steps:
1. Integrate all workflows
2. Create a simple CLI interface
3. Implement basic document management

### Implementation Details:
- Update `src/mastra/index.ts` to connect all components
- Create a simple CLI for document upload and form requests
- Focus on functionality rather than UI polish
- Use Mastra's orchestration capabilities to manage the workflow

### Success Criteria:
- All components work together
- CLI interface allows basic operations
- End-to-end process works for simple use cases

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies:
- `@mastra/core`: Core Mastra framework
- `@mastra/rag`: RAG capabilities for Mastra
- `pdf-parse`: PDF document processing
- `zod`: Schema validation
- Simple vector storage solution for the POC

### Environment Setup:
- OpenAI API key for embeddings and LLM
- Basic storage for the POC

## Testing Strategy

For this POC:
- Focus on functional testing of key components
- Use a small set of sample documents
- Test basic end-to-end flows
- Prioritize functionality verification over comprehensive testing
